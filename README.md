# Sharp-NeRF

This project builds upon the source code borrowed from the projects ![Deblur-NeRF](https://github.com/limacv/Deblur-NeRF) and ![nerf-pytorch
](https://github.com/yenchenlin/nerf-pytorch). We would like to thank the authors of these projects for their contributions. Additionally, some part of the code is borrowed from the [hdr-nerf](https://github.com/shsf0817/hdr-nerf) project to which ![Adwait Naik](https://github.com/addy1997) has also contributed. Please check my contributions [here](https://github.com/shsf0817/hdr-nerf/pull/5).

Please note that this source code only has the executable files and not the datasets used to train the model. The link to the dataset will be provided shortly.
