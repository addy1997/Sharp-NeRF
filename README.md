# Sharp-NeRF

This project builds upon the source code borrowed from the projects ![Deblur-NeRF](https://github.com/limacv/Deblur-NeRF) and ![nerf-pytorch
](https://github.com/yenchenlin/nerf-pytorch). We would like to thank the authors of these projects for their contributions. Additionally, some part of the code is borrowed from the [hdr-nerf](https://github.com/shsf0817/hdr-nerf) project to which ![Adwait Naik](https://github.com/addy1997) has also contributed. Please check my contributions [here](https://github.com/shsf0817/hdr-nerf/pull/5).

Please note that this source code only has the executable files and not the datasets used to train the model. The link to the dataset will be provided shortly.

The rendered views can be found in the `Results` folder. There are a few videos of of the real-world scenes rendered by the model. They mainly comprise of views from the `motion blur` category and from the `defocus blur` category, respectively.

All credit for the research, original viewer code and demo scene data goes to the [original authors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14292).
